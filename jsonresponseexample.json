I decided to elaborate on a couple of points that I also thought might be relevant, but too much for one\u00a0quote.<\/p>\n<h3>1. More gradients and vivid\u00a0colors<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with design aesthetics. Look &amp; feel, in my opinion, are just as important as user-flow and information architecture.<\/p>\n<p>A quick <a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/search?q=gradient+ui&amp;s=latest\">search on Dribbble<\/a> for latest shows exactly what I\u2019m talking about. The evolution of web\/app flat design and designers getting better with a minimalist approach.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*a1TFFEU1gtHNvWB_tuK0hA.png\"><figcaption><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/search?q=gradient+ui&amp;s=latest\">https:\/\/dribbble.com\/search?q=gradient+ui&amp;s=latest<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Flat design is cool and more relevant for modern devices. It definitely cuts out some of the bs, but it became way too cookie-cutter.<\/p>\n<p>Being a huge fan of minimalism, flat design and even these evolutions of the two with more vibrancy and almost a 1980s retro style. I\u2019m glad to see this evolution in\u00a0digital.<\/p>\n<p>Still, realism and skeuomorphism design approaches seem more suitable for certain things. For example, being a music producer, I understand how knobs &amp; levers work on emulation plugins in my DAW based on the skeuomorphic interface design because I\u2019ve used similar devices IRL <em>(in real\u00a0life)<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Some of my favorite audio plugins that try to emulate amazing sounding vintage or modern physical audio gear, look similar to that gear as well. I think it does two things: 1) gives the person a <em>\u201cit\u2019s gonna sound like this\u201d<\/em> <em>feeling<\/em> and 2) helps people less familiar with digital interfaces quickly navigate and\u00a0control.<\/p>\n<p>Joey Sturgis Tones plugins have some great examples of this type of\u00a0design.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*qg180zj3iTdIvjA_2KtEKw.jpeg\"><figcaption>Joey Sturgis Tones\u200a\u2014\u200a<a href=\"https:\/\/joeysturgistones.com\/\">https:\/\/joeysturgistones.com\/<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Others however, have moved towards a more modern design approach. Like the Fab Filter plugins. Still a tinge of realism, but it\u2019s very toned\u00a0down.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*mBD-vLxMJhuzAx1yOeVtoA@2x.jpeg\"><figcaption>Fabfilter Pro Q 2\u200a\u2014\u200a<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fabfilter.com\/products\/pro-q-2-equalizer-plug-in\">http:\/\/www.fabfilter.com\/products\/pro-q-2-equalizer-plug-in<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><p>But, I digress, we\u2019re talking about 2017 trends and I think bold colors and more fluid color movements win out on this front and I\u2019ll be interested to see how\/if they get applied to audio\u00a0plugins.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Better implementation for transitional and haptic\u00a0feedback<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/yummygum-journal\/enhance-your-user-experience-with-animated-transitions-a30267ca376c#.ckdpret40\">This article<\/a> is great for explaining what I\u2019m talking about here. It\u2019s important for UX designers to think about how life\u00a0<em>feels.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We live in a fluid world down to the smallest details. Even when we\u2019re staring a one thing it isn\u2019t \u201cstill\u201d because we\u2019re breathing and our eyes are slowly\u00a0moving.<\/p>\n<p>When we push something or bump into something smaller than us, it usually moves or wobbles\u2014depending on how dense it\u00a0is.<\/p>\n<p>Because of these facts, we as people don\u2019t like to see applications that twitch from one thing to the next. It feels\u00a0awkward.<\/p>\n<p>Apps have been and will continue to feel more life-like with feedback and physics based animations. Apple is keeping the game strong and UI designers\/animators around the world are pushing the boundaries so that the rest of the pack catches\u00a0up.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/597\/1*51ATMgKjbRh9mfK465r-wA.gif\"><figcaption>JavaScript cloth physics\u200a\u2014\u200alonely-pixel.com<\/figcaption><\/figure><h3>3. Experimental navigation systems &amp; micro-animations<\/h3>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/d509c36a449228de715058a5071402e0\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/d509c36a449228de715058a5071402e0\/href<\/a><p>Although they never really went away completely. Experimental user interfaces definitely took a backseat when the Apple pushed Adobe Flash out. I was a <a href=\"http:\/\/somethingcolorful.com\/\">big proponent of experiential web design<\/a> and I still am because I feel like we need high-end graphic design and unique takes on interaction design to push the needle\u00a0forward.<\/p>\n<p>Just writing in <em>this blog<\/em> here on Medium <em>(in the way that it edits)<\/em> is something that we might have created with Flash back in the day because \u201cmodern\u201d browsers or phones of the time couldn\u2019t do\u00a0it.<\/p>\n<p>Now that the technology of web browsers and the CPU power of mobile devices has caught up to where we were a few years back with Flash, I\u2019m starting to see more and more unique navigational systems that challenge people in just the right\u00a0ways.<\/p>\n<p>For the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.himss.org\/valuesuite\">HIMSS Health IT Value Suite<\/a>, I programmed a 3D node-based, question\/answer style navigation system that guides users to the right dataset for complex guideline information for Meaningful Use and other hospital &amp; provider based information.<\/p>\n<p>It can be seen in the intro of this video\u00a0below.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/82e19d68a3769903cccc58eb78141f58\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/82e19d68a3769903cccc58eb78141f58\/href<\/a><p>That application uses two amazing JavaScript libraries: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ericdrowell\/KineticJS\">KinteicJS<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/threejs.org\/\">ThreeJS<\/a>. ThreeJS was actually written by another Flash proponent of the web-design industry, <a href=\"http:\/\/mrdoob.com\/\">Mr.\u00a0Doob<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>4. More unnecessary chat\u00a0bots<\/h3>\n<p>Sales automation chatbots are terrible. Automated phone support is even worse. Sex robot solicitations on ICQ\u2026\u00a0garbage.<\/p>\n<p>Having \u201cimprovised fake\u201d conversations with people is not up to snuff yet. For the most part it\u2019s just annoying. And if it keeps being used for automating tasks via numbers like cell-phone support, it\u2019s\u00a0doomed.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/763\/1*08BKY24loU6Ku1h_1bkVjg.png\"><figcaption>Yahoo Messenger, circa 2004.\u00a0Sheesh..<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong><em>4-1. Also, some useful\u00a0ones.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2016\/10\/23\/8-chatbots-that-are-actually-helpful\/\">some exceptions<\/a> like the Slack bot, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/rachelarthur\/2016\/03\/30\/sephora-launches-chatbot-on-messaging-app-kik\/#107b0913512c\">Sephora\u2019s chat bot<\/a> and some of the other things that IBM, Microsoft and Amazon are\u00a0doing.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/512\/1*qHx1_dKtRhBPfPX9i2ofWQ.png\"><figcaption>Cute Slackbot\u00a0icon..<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Where the chatbot can and will be very useful is when applied to education, health and the things that facilitate everything else in human day-to-day life. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/4\/25\/11492102\/bill-gates-interview-education-software-artificial-intelligence\">Bill Gates spoke about this with Verge<\/a> earlier this year, and I think he\u2019s on to something.<\/p>\n<p><em>I would be interested to see a dolphin-2-dolphin chatbot. Who want\u2019s to\u00a0invest?<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5. Better sales funnel automation<\/h3>\n<p>Sales funnels have come a really long way. There\u2019s still no one setup that allows you to do everything you ever wanted to do to sell your stuff. But, it\u2019s getting\u00a0there.<\/p>\n<p>CRM and sales management tools are incredible, like InfusionSoft. Newer ones hope to simplify that process with less setup overhead, more automation and 3rd party software integration like ClickFunnels.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*0h-BF5hFJqA5IHeajUiepg.png\"><figcaption>Online sales funnel graphic borrowed from: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.crazyegg.com\/2014\/03\/01\/simple-sales-funnel\/\">https:\/\/blog.crazyegg.com\/2014\/03\/01\/simple-sales-funnel\/<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><p>There are a plethora of these types of automation tools. As a Ruby on Rails programmer, I\u2019ve even built some of these types of applications for specific routine purposes.<\/p>\n<p>In a product design sprint a couple years ago at <a href=\"http:\/\/adjustcreative.com\/\">Adjust Creative<\/a> we helped define and prototype a chatbot based CRM for one of our friends\/clients. It was a very fun UX challenge to try to design the user flow of lead management from a bot perspective.<\/p>\n<p>But, the real power is seeing them become not only more user friendly and have better information architecture, but to see these types of services start to use IBM Watson and other learning machines to<em> learn<\/em> to make decisive changes to a funnel based on analytics.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon is doing this quite well with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Amazon-Prime-Air\/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=8037720011\">Prime Air<\/a> and logistics. I\u2019m sure others will follow as they start to understand.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Better Augmented Reality and more Virtual\u00a0Reality<\/h3>\n<p>At <a href=\"http:\/\/domanistudios.com\/\">Domani Studios<\/a>, we prototyped an AR app for iPhone &amp; laptop camera for <a href=\"http:\/\/5gum.com\/\">5 gum<\/a> and built a set of online games for the <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.somethingcolorful.com\/\">US Air National Guard<\/a> in like 2008 or something. At the time the only really cool AR app was a Satsquatch that walked on your\u00a0desk.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/88c24b5e6822d2c85bf82c08eb97aee5\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/88c24b5e6822d2c85bf82c08eb97aee5\/href<\/a><p>Since\u2014it has grown up quite a\u00a0bit.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PGu0N3eL2D0\">LEGO implementation<\/a> of augmented reality at point of sale is maybe the most useful and playful. Also, there have been some cool business cards and magazine covers and whatnot. But, nothing that has truly changed our\u00a0lives.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ingress.com\/\">Google\u2019s Ingress<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pokemongo.com\/\">Nintendo\u2019s Pokemon Go<\/a> really opened up the flood gates in the last couple years and it doesn\u2019t seem the doors are closing anytime\u00a0soon.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>What about Virtual Reality\u00a0tho?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All the major game companies have been gearing up to and implementing amazing Virtual Reality into their systems across the globe because the technology is finally powerful enough and <em>cheap enough<\/em> to get to the consumers.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re going to see some incredible changes in our reality very soon. Aside from incredible console and computer gaming\u2014a couple of great examples of entertaining and useful VR could\u00a0be:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Boring train or airplane rides turned into explorations<\/li>\n<li>Theme park rides being augmented for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sixflags.com\/magicmountain\/attractions\/vr\/overview\">more exhilarating rides<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<li>Experiential and experimental artistic showcases like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theblackoutexperience.com\/\">Blackout Experience<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<li>The list can go on and\u00a0on..<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>What are the ways you can think of that normal day <em>\u201cI\u2019d rather be looking at my phone\u201d<\/em> times could be transformed into something fun, education or stimulating via\u00a0VR?<\/p>\n<h3>7. More use of real-time video within apps and websites for communication<\/h3>\n<p>Snapchat and Instagram are both incredible services and do awesome things with video technology. But, they are peaking right\u00a0now.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure what the next-gen version of immersive real-time video interaction is, but it\u2019s on it\u2019s way and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to see at least the beginnings of some awesome real-time video in\u00a02017.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*Cmx8HeaaNcKCKd3S0MJEew.jpeg\"><figcaption>Hopefully streaming Video + Virtual\u00a0Reality!<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>I\u2019ve actually been working on some real-time video projects with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thinktei.com\/#thinktei\">The Entertainment Institute<\/a> and\u00a0others.<\/p>\n<p>More on that topic later as well.\u00a0:)<\/p>\n<h3>8. Notification driven actions, rather than \u201copen my app to get to content\u201d\u00a0actions<\/h3>\n<blockquote>I think the thing that we will start to see impact User Experience in 2017 is more authentic feeling and conversational automation. Not only are we designing pretty graphics, we\u2019re designing them for human beings and a lot of times with a massive services behind\u00a0them.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>What I\u2019m referring to isn\u2019t exactly something immediately tangible, like more gradients, streaming video or tiny micro-animations (which will happen more also in 2017), but more of an outcome of the recent push of empathetic choices when designing digital products.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>But, with learning-computer and analytics technologies like IBM Watson developing at a rapid pace, I think what we will start to see more of is more conversational and action-oriented notification systems that help guide us through digital applications in the right way\u200a\u2014\u200abased on who we are and how we use\u00a0them.<\/blockquote>\n<p><em>You can read the full article here: <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/tomaslaurinavicius\/2016\/12\/04\/ux-trends-2017\/2\"><strong><em>UX Trends 2017: Experts Bet On AI, Chatbots And\u00a0VR<\/em><\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>9.

Sex robot solicitations on ICQ\u2026\u00a0garbage.<\/p>\n<p>Having \u201cimprovised fake\u201d conversations with people is not up to snuff yet. For the most part it\u2019s just annoying. And if it keeps being used for automating tasks via numbers like cell-phone support, it\u2019s\u00a0doomed.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/763\/1*08BKY24loU6Ku1h_1bkVjg.png\"><figcaption>Yahoo Messenger, circa 2004.\u00a0Sheesh..<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong><em>4-1.

There\u2019s still no one setup that allows you to do everything you ever wanted to do to sell your stuff. But, it\u2019s getting\u00a0there.<\/p>\n<p>CRM and sales management tools are incredible, like InfusionSoft. Newer ones hope to simplify that process with less setup overhead, more automation and 3rd party software integration like ClickFunnels.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*0h-BF5hFJqA5IHeajUiepg.png\"><figcaption>Online sales funnel graphic borrowed from: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.crazyegg.com\/2014\/03\/01\/simple-sales-funnel\/\">https:\/\/blog.crazyegg.com\/2014\/03\/01\/simple-sales-funnel\/<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><p>There are a plethora of these types of automation tools.

It was a very fun UX challenge to try to design the user flow of lead management from a bot perspective.<\/p>\n<p>But, the real power is seeing them become not only more user friendly and have better information architecture, but to see these types of services start to use IBM Watson and other learning machines to<em> learn<\/em> to make decisive changes to a funnel based on analytics.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon is doing this quite well with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Amazon-Prime-Air\/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=8037720011\">Prime Air<\/a> and logistics. I\u2019m sure others will follow as they start to understand.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Better Augmented Reality and more Virtual\u00a0Reality<\/h3>\n<p>At <a href=\"http:\/\/domanistudios.com\/\">Domani Studios<\/a>, we prototyped an AR app for iPhone &amp; laptop camera for <a href=\"http:\/\/5gum.com\/\">5 gum<\/a> and built a set of online games for the <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.somethingcolorful.com\/\">US Air National Guard<\/a> in like 2008 or something.

More use of real-time video within apps and websites for communication<\/h3>\n<p>Snapchat and Instagram are both incredible services and do awesome things with video technology. But, they are peaking right\u00a0now.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure what the next-gen version of immersive real-time video interaction is, but it\u2019s on it\u2019s way and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to see at least the beginnings of some awesome real-time video in\u00a02017.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*Cmx8HeaaNcKCKd3S0MJEew.jpeg\"><figcaption>Hopefully streaming Video + Virtual\u00a0Reality!<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>I\u2019ve actually been working on some real-time video projects with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thinktei.com\/#thinktei\">The Entertainment Institute<\/a> and\u00a0others.<\/p>\n<p>More on that topic later as well.\u00a0:)<\/p>\n<h3>8.

User Experience is a term that doesn\u2019t properly describe what it is actually trying to describe.<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s a great article I read a few years ago by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2011\/03\/why-user-experience-cannot-be-designed\/\">Helge Fredheim<\/a> that I\u2019ve always thought, but could never quite articulate properly.<\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell, most think the term <em>User Experience<\/em> means to \u201cdesign an experience\u201d using graphics, user flows (funnels, etc), services &amp;\u00a0tech.<\/p>\n<p>But, that\u2019s impossible.<\/p>\n<blockquote>A <em>person<\/em> is a human being with emotions, reason and uses tools to accomplish tasks and\u00a0ideas.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>A <em>user<\/em> is someone who uses tools, devices or for medicinal purposes, drugs.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<em>An <\/em>Experience is a series of emotional responses a person feels during a time, place and specific\u00a0context.<\/blockquote>\n<p>In fact, <em>User Experience design (UX) <\/em>should be called by it\u2019s actual name Interaction Design (IxD) and it really is designing to <em>allow<\/em> someone to have a positive experience while interacting with computers.<\/p>\n<h3>3. There are statistical patterns within groups of people. But, people are not statistics.<\/h3>\n<p>Statistics are fantastic. We have so much information shared into computer servers these days that there are <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Big_data\">new industries evolving<\/a> just to understand our patterns, help us learn faster and in some cases\u2014<a href=\"http:\/\/www.infoworld.com\/article\/3039052\/cloud-computing\/how-ibm-google-microsoft-and-amazon-do-machine-learning-in-the-cloud.html\">learn for\u00a0us<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><em>What\u2019s the easiest example we can think of involving human behavior patterns?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I would say it\u2019s probably that we mostly converge around large bodies of water.

Understanding groups, subgroups, genres, etc. can help us reach the folks we want to talk to using communication techniques aimed at them while we\u2019re out shaking hands or with algorithms and target-marketing t0ols on the internet.<\/p>\n<p>But, again, most of the people that you are trying to reach using those tools are people with desires and aren\u2019t just using a piece of tech for the sake of\u00a0it.<\/p>\n<h3>4. The more empathetic you are to the people that use your digital goods\u2014the happier they will be to use\u00a0them.<\/h3>\n<p>I feel like this George Orwell quote just about sums it\u00a0up:<\/p>\n<blockquote>If you see somebody begging under a bridge you might feel sorry and toss them a coin, that\u2019s not empathy, it\u2019s sympathy. Empathy is when you have a conversation, try to understand how they feel about life, what it\u2019s like sleeping outside on a cold winter\u2019s night.\u200a\u2014\u200aGeorge\u00a0Orwell<\/blockquote>\n<p>The same is true with the people you\u2019re communicating with online.

Then, changing what it is you\u2019re trying to give them by making it more valuable to\u00a0them.<\/p>\n<p>This is how great businesses and thought leaders go through\u00a0life.<\/p>\n<p>The importance of empathy only increases as humans evolve. I think there\u2019s an incredible <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gzhkn9BnRmU\">TED talk by Katri Saarikivi<\/a> that you should watch. She covers the topic in\u00a0depth.<\/p>\n<h3>5.

Let\u2019s think about the things that are happening in any given moment while driving a\u00a0car.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>the muscle memories: foot on the gas, brain controlling your leg and foot, gear shifters, steering wheel,\u00a0etc<\/li>\n<li>a TON of information about your surroundings in various forms: 3\u20135 mirrors, windows, various gauges &amp; multipliers to help you judge distance, fuel, speed, mileage,\u00a0etc.<\/li>\n<li>The environmental &amp; time based notifiers: on the fly math for distance markers, travel speeds, resting\/gas, problems, etc<\/li>\n<li>Cell phones, GPS and other digital devices you\u2019re using but shouldn\u2019t be<\/li>\n<li>Your passengers: screaming kids, people watching movies, conversations, etc<\/li>\n<li>Not to mention the amount of other folks doing the same thing that need attention and\u00a0priority<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>All that in any given moment\u2014just to drive a\u00a0car.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s my point: If you\u2019re thinking about the person operating that car as a possible <em>user <\/em>of your new \u201cparking finder app\u201d\u2014you\u2019re doing it\u00a0wrong.<\/p>\n<p>That person is <em>using<\/em> many tools and probably doesn\u2019t need yours.

I\u2019ve developed applications with iOS and helped with some on Android in the past. So, we had a pretty good understanding of the platform and what it brings to the\u00a0table.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re about to dive into React Native, definitely read Ruoyu Sun\u2019s article: <a href=\"http:\/\/ruoyusun.com\/2015\/11\/01\/things-i-wish-i-were-told-about-react-native.html\">Things I Wish I Were Told About React Native<\/a> first and if you\u2019re not used to JavaScript es6, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/lukehoban\/es6features\">take a look at\u00a0this<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That said, hitting the ground running wasn\u2019t bad for me because I\u2019ve been programming things for 17 years. A lot of the research was done on the fly and I\u2019ll try to outline some of my thoughts\u00a0below.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Note: If you\u2019re new to programming\u200a\u2014\u200athis article is not going to get you up to speed as it covers a couple of topics, but there is no finished production code to use in entirety.<\/blockquote>\n<p>Getting setup for iOS was streamlined, <a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/docs\/getting-started.html\">a couple of terminal lines<\/a> to generate a starting boilerplate, set a couple of configuration spots in Xcode and\u00a0go!<\/p>\n<p>For Android on the other hand, I had quite a few hick-ups because I didn\u2019t have the proper Java SDKs and things like that. The setup for Android environment took me a fair amount of <a href=\"http:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/releases\/0.23\/docs\/android-setup.html\">thorough reading<\/a> and wasn\u2019t as <a href=\"http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/19986214\/setting-android-home-enviromental-variable-on-mac-os-x\">straightforward as I thought<\/a> it would be. However, I did get past all the environment setup and into my first ReactNative error (<em>backgroundImage fail<\/em>) in about 2\u00a0hours.<\/p>\n<p>Once I was up and running, I had to modify not only the boilerplate code a bit but also the code that was used for iOS because it seems there are noticeable differences in the JavaScript side of things as the Android version was released\u00a0second.<\/p>\n<h3>Get that\u00a0data!<\/h3>\n<p>First things first, I needed some data to play with. Luckily, <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@yoniweisbrod\/interacting-with-apis-using-react-native-fetch-9733f28566bb#.snvi442bk\">Yoni Weisbrod<\/a> wrote a great article about loading data with React\u00a0Native.<\/p>\n<p>I wrote a couple of functions to fetch the feeds and run them through the <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/feed\/\">Google Feed API<\/a> so that they would have a consistent data structure.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/f3ca08e990e58b190d4764899e1c0864\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/f3ca08e990e58b190d4764899e1c0864\/href<\/a><p>Each time a feed loads, it runs through this function that checks to see if all feeds are loaded (or error\u2019d) and parses the data into a stored data object for setting the component state with\u00a0later.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/421e9a274b675603d30befe670b3fcd1\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/421e9a274b675603d30befe670b3fcd1\/href<\/a><p>Not bad, right?

Some friends over at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bigspaceship.com\/\">Big Spaceship<\/a> made it back when I was working at <a href=\"http:\/\/domanistudios.com\/\">Domani Studios<\/a>. We made a lot of websites with Adobe Flash and since they were pretty heavy files, most of the time we needed <em>SICK PRE-LOADERS BRO<\/em>.<em> (look for the one with dripping countdown)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Also, side note: We didn\u2019t make those ugly flash sites that everyone hated. We made truly immersive experiences that were highly interactive, engaging and the User Experience was\u2026 ahem\u2026 ahead of it\u2019s time. (and still\u00a0do)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Anyway, the in the loading screen, I\u2019m using React Native\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/releases\/next\/docs\/animations.html\">Animated<\/a> component to drop in the logo and fade in the shadow. It\u2019s quite easy to implement and reminds me of the patterns used in <a href=\"https:\/\/greensock.com\/\">TweenLite<\/a> or for the old-school, <a href=\"http:\/\/hosted.zeh.com.br\/mctween\/\">MCTween<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Custom Swipes and 3D transitions and\u00a0stuff<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This was the only part where I didn\u2019t get to use the simple React Native components. It took the longest because I had to custom program the View controller.<\/p>\n<p>React Native provides you with a couple of out-of-the-box navigation utilities like <a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/docs\/using-navigators.html\">Navigator<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/docs\/navigatorios.html\">NavigatorIOS<\/a>. But, after a couple of failed attempts at trying to extend them for my purposes, I decided to just write a swiping page controller myself.<\/p>\n<p>I knew that I wanted it to have a left\/right <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gotinder.com\/\">Tinder<\/a> style swipe to go through each post <em>(minus all the photos of people being super cool in a different country) <\/em>and that I wanted the transitions from post to post to be elegant and feel very comfortable to\u00a0use.<\/p>\n<p>So, I went to town programming my own View controller, which may get added to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/\">npm<\/a> because people seem to like\u00a0it.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to go full into the entire component in this article, but I do want to outline a couple parts of core functionality.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/500\/1*17JKxwhzGwZgRiVz-scU9A.gif\"><\/figure><p><strong>There are only 3 Views at any given\u00a0time.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no reason to create View\u2019s all the time and there\u2019s not enough CPU to generate a new View for each item in the data. So, the three views get updated with the relevant current data and the controller moves them around while you use your finger back or\u00a0forward.<\/p>\n<p>To be honest, it should probably just be two views and the \u201cnext\u201d one is decided by the direction you\u2019re moving, but I like thinking of them on either side for some reason and it\u2019s really not much different in terms of overhead.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/7798f00a615f044c2b9620b75d8d312d\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/7798f00a615f044c2b9620b75d8d312d\/href<\/a><p><strong>PanResponder is\u00a0nice.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The math to move the Views happens in a couple places and is controlled by <a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/releases\/next\/docs\/panresponder.html\">PanResponder<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The most important is the \u201con move\u201d and the \u201con end\u201d event listeners.

The setup for Android environment took me a fair amount of <a href=\"http:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/releases\/0.23\/docs\/android-setup.html\">thorough reading<\/a> and wasn\u2019t as <a href=\"http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/19986214\/setting-android-home-enviromental-variable-on-mac-os-x\">straightforward as I thought<\/a> it would be. However, I did get past all the environment setup and into my first ReactNative error (<em>backgroundImage fail<\/em>) in about 2\u00a0hours.<\/p>\n<p>Once I was up and running, I had to modify not only the boilerplate code a bit but also the code that was used for iOS because it seems there are noticeable differences in the JavaScript side of things as the Android version was released\u00a0second.<\/p>\n<h3>Get that\u00a0data!<\/h3>\n<p>First things first, I needed some data to play with.

It took the longest because I had to custom program the View controller.<\/p>\n<p>React Native provides you with a couple of out-of-the-box navigation utilities like <a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/docs\/using-navigators.html\">Navigator<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/docs\/navigatorios.html\">NavigatorIOS<\/a>. But, after a couple of failed attempts at trying to extend them for my purposes, I decided to just write a swiping page controller myself.<\/p>\n<p>I knew that I wanted it to have a left\/right <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gotinder.com\/\">Tinder<\/a> style swipe to go through each post <em>(minus all the photos of people being super cool in a different country) <\/em>and that I wanted the transitions from post to post to be elegant and feel very comfortable to\u00a0use.<\/p>\n<p>So, I went to town programming my own View controller, which may get added to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/\">npm<\/a> because people seem to like\u00a0it.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to go full into the entire component in this article, but I do want to outline a couple parts of core functionality.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/500\/1*17JKxwhzGwZgRiVz-scU9A.gif\"><\/figure><p><strong>There are only 3 Views at any given\u00a0time.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no reason to create View\u2019s all the time and there\u2019s not enough CPU to generate a new View for each item in the data. So, the three views get updated with the relevant current data and the controller moves them around while you use your finger back or\u00a0forward.<\/p>\n<p>To be honest, it should probably just be two views and the \u201cnext\u201d one is decided by the direction you\u2019re moving, but I like thinking of them on either side for some reason and it\u2019s really not much different in terms of overhead.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/7798f00a615f044c2b9620b75d8d312d\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/7798f00a615f044c2b9620b75d8d312d\/href<\/a><p><strong>PanResponder is\u00a0nice.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The math to move the Views happens in a couple places and is controlled by <a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/releases\/next\/docs\/panresponder.html\">PanResponder<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The most important is the \u201con move\u201d and the \u201con end\u201d event listeners.

If you\u2019re a design and development consultancy like us, you have most likely felt this frustration at some point\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe even all the time. But, if you\u2019re a non-technical person, these topics can be even more overwhelming.<\/p>\n<p>At <a href=\"http:\/\/adjustcreative.com\/\"><strong>Adjust<\/strong><\/a>, we have been exploring ways that we can efficiently bridge the gap between web &amp; mobile for our clients and ourselves to alleviate this frustration. For our team, this means a few\u00a0things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using existing skills and programming languages in smarter\u00a0ways;<\/li>\n<li>Thinking more and more API-first: create the business logic and how the backend works so that you can display it anywhere\u200a\u2014\u200ain a browser on your computer, natively on a phone or tablet, or on any number of other devices that make\u00a0sense;<\/li>\n<li>Continuing to look for ways to make first-class cross-platform solutions (iOS, Android, and more) without completely separate code\u00a0bases<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For those reasons, we\u2019re excited to explore Facebook\u2019s framework, <a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/\"><strong>React Native<\/strong><\/a>, for new client projects\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially those that are \u201cgreenfield\u201d (where no current technology stack or code debt\u00a0exists).<\/p>\n<h3>What is React\u00a0Native?<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with what it is not: React Native is NOT a \u201chybrid\u201d or \u201cHTML5\/mobile web app.\u201d From <a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/\">the\u00a0source<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\u201cWith React Native\u00a0\u2026 You build a real mobile app that\u2019s indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and\u00a0React.\u201d<\/blockquote>\n<p>Unlike hybrid apps of the past that are written in pure HTML\/CSS\/JavaScript and then embedded in an internet browser wrapped inside an \u201capp\u201d facade, React Native does two primary things: first, it uses JavaScript to call and use native components, modules, and functionality; and second, it allows the creation of custom components directly via JavaScript. The React app runs native code and custom JavaScript on separate threads. This means the application receives all of the first-class benefits of being a native app, including fast touch events and scrolling, use of native interface libraries and hardware APIs, and\u00a0more.<\/p>\n<p>In short, a React Native app acts, looks, and feels like an app exclusively written in native\u00a0code!<\/p>\n<p>There are other solutions that try to do this as well, including <a href=\"https:\/\/coronalabs.com\/\">Corona<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/unity3d.com\/\">Unity<\/a> on the high-end gaming side and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appcelerator.com\/\">Appcelerator<\/a> on the JavaScript side and we\u2019ve tried them, too. However, since our browser-based applications are now being developed with <a href=\"https:\/\/code.facebook.com\/projects\/176988925806765\/react\/\">React<\/a>, decreased development time and a shared code base is\u00a0key.<\/p>\n<h3>Development Advantages<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to allowing us to flex longstanding JavaScript development skills, we\u2019re excited about React Native\u00a0because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is easier to incorporate developers with a traditional front-end programming background into the\u00a0project;<\/li>\n<li>It can be bridged to integrate native Objective-C or Swift (iOS), and Java (Android) code libraries;<\/li>\n<li>It is possible to repurpose as much as 85% of the codebase when building for both iOS and\u00a0Android;<\/li>\n<li>It is possible to push incremental app updates without submitting new versions to the iOS App Store and Google Play\u00a0Store;<\/li>\n<li>It is built for developer happiness and introduces greatly improved debugging tools alongside a familiar language in JavaScript;<\/li>\n<li>It was created and is sponsored by Facebook and has an exponentially growing Open Source community behind\u00a0it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/\">React Native | A framework for building native apps using React<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Does it make coffee,\u00a0too?<\/h3>\n<p>React Native sounds too good to be true and that should set off at least some alarms. It\u2019s not perfect; every native UI component is not directly available yet and, given that iOS was the first target, it enjoys a more feature-complete set of tools than does Android\u200a\u2014\u200abut this will continue to even out as React Native and its ecosystem matures.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*BXkkZ9d5IasXYsFZendl3Q.jpeg\"><\/figure><h3>Startup Advantages<\/h3>\n<p>We think this is important for companies at all stages because the days of building for just one platform are quickly becoming a thing of the past. Choosing a technology stack that allows for the potential of both a smaller development team and one that leverages a greater pool of talent (by allowing JavaScript developers to contribute); one that allows for such a significant amount of shared code between native platforms; and one that allows for incremental testing, updates, and releases without app store approval processes all seem like a great fit for companies that need to iterate and move fast with small\u00a0teams.<\/p>\n<h3>Who is using React\u00a0Native?<\/h3>\n<p>Well, <strong>Facebook<\/strong>, of course! They have written about integrating React Native into portions of the main Facebook mobile apps, such as in the <a href=\"https:\/\/code.facebook.com\/posts\/895897210527114\/dive-into-react-native-performance\/\">Events dashboard<\/a>.

Spoiler alert: it went so well that they\u2019re rebuilding their existing Android Pulse app to be part of the same React Native code base. They\u2019re also using it to build an internal app; and they\u2019re starting to identify components of the main SoundCloud app to re-write in React Native\u00a0views.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discovery<\/strong> created a VR app using React Native and <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/ios-os-x-development\/an-ios-developer-on-react-native-1f24786c29f0#.mx355jeci\">published an article<\/a> from a developer\u2019s perspective on the switch from Objective-C and\u00a0Swift.<\/p>\n<p>For a startup perspective, the solo developer for <strong>Townske<\/strong>, which launched web-first, <a href=\"https:\/\/hackernoon.com\/townske-app-in-react-native-6ad557de7a7c#.3rqd6uy8i\">writes about the advantages<\/a> of creating their iOS app in React Native.

If you\u2019re a design and development consultancy like us, you have most likely felt this frustration at some point\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe even all the time. But, if you\u2019re a non-technical person, these topics can be even more overwhelming.<\/p>\n<p>At <a href=\"http:\/\/adjustcreative.com\/\"><strong>Adjust<\/strong><\/a>, we have been exploring ways that we can efficiently bridge the gap between web &amp; mobile for our clients and ourselves to alleviate this frustration. For our team, this means a few\u00a0things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using existing skills and programming languages in smarter\u00a0ways;<\/li>\n<li>Thinking more and more API-first: create the business logic and how the backend works so that you can display it anywhere\u200a\u2014\u200ain a browser on your computer, natively on a phone or tablet, or on any number of other devices that make\u00a0sense;<\/li>\n<li>Continuing to look for ways to make first-class cross-platform solutions (iOS, Android, and more) without completely separate code\u00a0bases<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For those reasons, we\u2019re excited to explore Facebook\u2019s framework, <a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/\"><strong>React Native<\/strong><\/a>, for new client projects\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially those that are \u201cgreenfield\u201d (where no current technology stack or code debt\u00a0exists).<\/p>\n<h3>What is React\u00a0Native?<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with what it is not: React Native is NOT a \u201chybrid\u201d or \u201cHTML5\/mobile web app.\u201d From <a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/\">the\u00a0source<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\u201cWith React Native\u00a0\u2026 You build a real mobile app that\u2019s indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and\u00a0React.\u201d<\/blockquote>\n<p>Unlike hybrid apps of the past that are written in pure HTML\/CSS\/JavaScript and then embedded in an internet browser wrapped inside an \u201capp\u201d facade, React Native does two primary things: first, it uses JavaScript to call and use native components, modules, and functionality; and second, it allows the creation of custom components directly via JavaScript. The React app runs native code and custom JavaScript on separate threads. This means the application receives all of the first-class benefits of being a native app, including fast touch events and scrolling, use of native interface libraries and hardware APIs, and\u00a0more.<\/p>\n<p>In short, a React Native app acts, looks, and feels like an app exclusively written in native\u00a0code!<\/p>\n<p>There are other solutions that try to do this as well, including <a href=\"https:\/\/coronalabs.com\/\">Corona<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/unity3d.com\/\">Unity<\/a> on the high-end gaming side and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appcelerator.com\/\">Appcelerator<\/a> on the JavaScript side and we\u2019ve tried them, too. However, since our browser-based applications are now being developed with <a href=\"https:\/\/code.facebook.com\/projects\/176988925806765\/react\/\">React<\/a>, decreased development time and a shared code base is\u00a0key.<\/p>\n<h3>Development Advantages<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to allowing us to flex longstanding JavaScript development skills, we\u2019re excited about React Native\u00a0because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is easier to incorporate developers with a traditional front-end programming background into the\u00a0project;<\/li>\n<li>It can be bridged to integrate native Objective-C or Swift (iOS), and Java (Android) code libraries;<\/li>\n<li>It is possible to repurpose as much as 85% of the codebase when building for both iOS and\u00a0Android;<\/li>\n<li>It is possible to push incremental app updates without submitting new versions to the iOS App Store and Google Play\u00a0Store;<\/li>\n<li>It is built for developer happiness and introduces greatly improved debugging tools alongside a familiar language in JavaScript;<\/li>\n<li>It was created and is sponsored by Facebook and has an exponentially growing Open Source community behind\u00a0it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/\">React Native | A framework for building native apps using React<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Does it make coffee,\u00a0too?<\/h3>\n<p>React Native sounds too good to be true and that should set off at least some alarms. It\u2019s not perfect; every native UI component is not directly available yet and, given that iOS was the first target, it enjoys a more feature-complete set of tools than does Android\u200a\u2014\u200abut this will continue to even out as React Native and its ecosystem matures.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*BXkkZ9d5IasXYsFZendl3Q.jpeg\"><\/figure><h3>Startup Advantages<\/h3>\n<p>We think this is important for companies at all stages because the days of building for just one platform are quickly becoming a thing of the past. Choosing a technology stack that allows for the potential of both a smaller development team and one that leverages a greater pool of talent (by allowing JavaScript developers to contribute); one that allows for such a significant amount of shared code between native platforms; and one that allows for incremental testing, updates, and releases without app store approval processes all seem like a great fit for companies that need to iterate and move fast with small\u00a0teams.<\/p>\n<h3>Who is using React\u00a0Native?<\/h3>\n<p>Well, <strong>Facebook<\/strong>, of course!

Spoiler alert: it went so well that they\u2019re rebuilding their existing Android Pulse app to be part of the same React Native code base. They\u2019re also using it to build an internal app; and they\u2019re starting to identify components of the main SoundCloud app to re-write in React Native\u00a0views.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discovery<\/strong> created a VR app using React Native and <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/ios-os-x-development\/an-ios-developer-on-react-native-1f24786c29f0#.mx355jeci\">published an article<\/a> from a developer\u2019s perspective on the switch from Objective-C and\u00a0Swift.<\/p>\n<p>For a startup perspective, the solo developer for <strong>Townske<\/strong>, which launched web-first, <a href=\"https:\/\/hackernoon.com\/townske-app-in-react-native-6ad557de7a7c#.3rqd6uy8i\">writes about the advantages<\/a> of creating their iOS app in React Native.

It had a dangly cord that would drape across the kitchen while my mom talked to her friends and cooked us food at the same\u00a0time.<\/p>\n<p>The food was delicious, btw.\u00a0;)<\/p>\n<p>What was your first smartphone? Or, if you\u2019re old enough, what was your first cell\u00a0phone?<\/p>\n<p>In my formative years, up to the age of twenty-one, I didn\u2019t have or want a cell phone. Imagine that\u200a\u2014\u200aa tech dork who doesn\u2019t want a cell\u00a0phone!<\/p>\n<p>My first cell phone came from my boss forcing me his extra to keep just-in-case he needed me when I worked at my first software dev\u00a0shop.<\/p>\n<p>A couple years after that, a friend gave me a hand-me-down Palm Treo and that was my intro to smartphones. The Palm Treo was MASSIVE. It was like a Blackberry on steroids. I seriously felt like Zack Morris from Saved by the Bell, but in the 2000s with a calculator for a\u00a0phone.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/500\/0*jVpf7jTupYCnSHmp.\"><\/figure><p>When Apple announced the first generation iPhone, I was ecstatic and pre-ordered it immediately (because lines are\u00a0dumb).<\/p>\n<p>I used iPhones for a\u00a0while.<\/p>\n<p>I dropped one in a\u00a0toilet.<\/p>\n<p>I broke, replaced and upgraded others for a while before switching to the Google Nexus family a few years\u00a0ago.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I\u2019m back using an iPhone and still have the Android for development purposes (as we\u2019re constantly helping companies design and develop cutting-edge digital products *wink* at <a href=\"http:\/\/adjustcreative.com\/\">Adjust Creative<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the complexities of the information that needs to be presented, sometimes we have to design two or more interfaces for different devices and sometimes we can retain a design metaphor and brand across multiple devices effectively.<\/p>\n<p>This article is a look at similarities and differences in user interaction design to understand the best approach at making an app for two very popular devices\u200a\u2014\u200aa <strong>Google Nexus 5<\/strong> running <strong>Android Marshmallow (6.0.1)<\/strong> and an <strong>Apple iPhone 6s<\/strong> running <strong>iOS 9 <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/ios\/ios10-preview\/\"><em>(even though iOS 10 is around the corner so I\u2019ll have to update this article)<\/em><\/a>.

But, that\u2019s ok, it\u2019s still relevant right now and a fun topic to\u00a0analyze!<\/p>\n<h3>Boutique vs Pragmatic\u200a\u2014\u200athe eternal argument\u2026<\/h3>\n<p>Like other Apple products, iOS still feels more elegant and like it has been <em>crafted<\/em> for me. Google\u2019s Android still feels a bit clunky and <strong>VERY LOUD<\/strong> with color choices and too much white space around\u00a0icons.<\/p>\n<p>Bold colors on Android are not only kind of distracting sometimes, if the designer of the product or app isn\u2019t great at understanding the guidelines and context, can be abused or misused and result in a UX disaster.<\/p>\n<p>On iOS, content feels more important than global\/standardized navigation\u200a\u2014\u200abut I think they should be weighted\u00a0better.<\/p>\n<p>I like that the content is king\u200a\u2014\u200abut the icons being just outlines really doesn\u2019t make them more out of the way\u200a\u2014\u200ait just makes them look tiny, noisy and\u00a0forced.<\/p>\n<p>The things that I like about iOS and their <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/ios\/human-interface-guidelines\/\">Human Interface Guidelines<\/a> are a lot of the things I like about modern design in general which are minimalist, but not without personality.

Luckily, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/3\/15\/11236152\/material-design-update-bottom-navigation-bar\">this has been updated<\/a> in their <a href=\"https:\/\/material.google.com\/components\/bottom-navigation.html#bottom-navigation-usage\">Material Design guidelines<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>If it has smooth moves or reacts, I like it\u00a0more.<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Transitioning from app to\u00a0app<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In terms of motion design for transitioning to and from apps, the homescreen and other parts of the system, Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MwWmVafvuAI\">zoom animation<\/a> style feels more appropriate when navigating to and from home and app to app unlike Android\u2019s unmasking or sliding up from the\u00a0bottom.<\/p>\n<p>But, the sliding drawers for notifications on Android feel more appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, iOS gives me a sense of \u201ctraveling smoothly\u201d and without being obnoxious to get to different parts of the platform.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Consistency<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Since Google has released the <a href=\"https:\/\/material.google.com\/\">Material Design Guidelines<\/a>, consistent color change states for active vs inactive icons as well as toggles, text and other things within 3rd party apps feel like they are getting more and more consistent in terms of design patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Some of those patterns are now starting to make their way into iOS as well\u200a\u2014\u200afor better or\u00a0worse.<\/p>\n<p>iOS has a lot of consistency, but it feels like a fair amount of the apps abandon their guidelines or don\u2019t follow their lead in terms of animation and gestures. Maybe I\u2019m just noticing that due to the sheer number of applications available for the\u00a0iPhone.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Gestures &amp;\u00a0Feedback<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The Android OS has always had a head start on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/11-features-apple-borrowed-from-android-in-the-last-year-2015-7\/#ple-added-widgets-to-the-iphone-last-fall-in-ios-8-which-android-phones-have-had-since-around-2009-8\">certain features<\/a>. I feel like gesture-based navigation patterns are and were better on Android. iOS has gotten WAY BETTER over the\u00a0years.<\/p>\n<p>Still, some things that Google has designed for user feedback with gestures makes a lot of\u00a0sense.<\/p>\n<p>The best example is the <a href=\"https:\/\/material.google.com\/motion\/material-motion.html\">immediate response animations<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When I tap on something within Android\u200a\u2014\u200aI see a \u201chit area\u201d with a subtle ripple effect and when I pull on a list or other pullable element and it\u2019s at the end of it\u2019s scroll, the \u201cend of the road\u201d pull feedback helps me quickly understand what\u2019s happening and to move\u00a0on.<\/p>\n<p>One of the other gestures that I love about the Android OS has to do with Notifications and settings, which I outlined\u00a0earlier.<\/p>\n<p>They\u2019re also a lot easier to find on Android. When I pull down from the top with a quick swipe, I can see my current notifications. Then, if I pull a second time, I get the common quick settings shown\u00a0earlier.<\/p>\n<p>From this view, if I want to go to detailed settings and advanced options, I can tap the gear icon and do that. This just feels\u00a0better.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m also a huge fan of just swiping left or right to remove notifications from my pending collection and pulling on them to open up quick options within Android. That also seems more logical than swiping then\u00a0tapping.<\/p>\n<p>But, it\u2019s just a different pattern, not really better than\u00a0iOS.<\/p>\n<p><em>(Note: in Android 7 it seems that they\u2019ve added some icons above the Notifications to jump quickly to certain settings.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>On the iOS side of things, I love the 3D touch gesture to quickly peek at things to get context before interacting with them. I also really like when there are \u201chidden actions\u201d to do more complex things that can be uncovered by swipe type gestures. The problem I see is that it\u2019s inconsistent and I think they get lost a lot of\u00a0times.<\/p>\n<h3>Let\u2019s see some\u00a0pics!<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at some visual comparisons of the designs of both system level and 3rd party app\u00a0designs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Notifications from the lock\u00a0screen<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*ivjsDky0Yj-tTMmW.\"><\/figure><p>Notifications are a bit more streamlined in Android.

That\u2019s not what Google would\u00a0do.<\/p>\n<p>The thing that\u2019s interesting is that after using both, I think the hidden menu on Android hinders me and what I\u2019m looking for on\u00a0Spotify.<\/p>\n<h3>Apps with Different UI Design\u00a0Patterns<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Facebook<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*iRf5TEFHWk5Ev08E.\"><\/figure><p>The Facebook app is maybe the most different from platform to platform.

They do a great job at not only branding and trying to be disruptive, but also following the design guidelines from Apple and Google almost EXACTLY for each\u00a0app.<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, they do it very, very\u00a0well.<\/p>\n<h3>Complaints<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Where is my damn phone\u00a0number?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s 2016 and I don\u2019t have time to memorize phone numbers. My phone takes care of it for me and I can concentrate on things I\u2019m good at. This is a struggle for me when talking to say, a phone or utilities company representative and I need to give them the phone number of the phone and I can\u2019t find\u00a0it.<\/p>\n<p>Android hides the phone number in an illogical place:<\/p>\n<p><em>Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Status &gt; SIM Status &gt; My Phone\u00a0Number<\/em><\/p>\n<p>iOS hides the phone number in a logical\u00a0place:<\/p>\n<p><em>Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Phone\u00a0Number<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Not enough transparency on\u00a0iOS..<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I know it\u2019s a cliche, but I\u2019m a computer nerd and I like to have more control over how and when I use files. Not having a file system is very annoying.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll explain <strong><em>one<\/em><\/strong> of my reasons for this complaint:<\/p>\n<p>I write and record a lot of music. When I\u2019m done for that day\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019ll bounce my music down to an mp3 and put it in a shared folder on Google Drive so all the people I\u2019m collaborating with or want feedback from can have the most current\u00a0files.<\/p>\n<p>On Android, I can easily download those mp3s and play them with the default apps or 3rd party ones. However, on iOS, due to the lack of transparent file system\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m not be able to do that and am forced to download 3rd party software to interface with cloud storage or convert things in iTunes and sync the\u00a0phone.<\/p>\n<p>Now, this may sound like a lame complaint\u200a\u2014\u200abut for someone who uses computers and technology as much as I do\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s very frustrating to not have the ability to download files on whatever device I need those files currently to manipulate, read, upload somewhere or email to someone that needs\u00a0it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Android still has bugs\u2026\u00a0still..<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s just because Android is more transparent about it and shows me when bugs happen, but it feels like there are at least 1\u20132 bugs every time I have do a lot with the phone at\u00a0once.<\/p>\n<p>I could probably go on, but let\u2019s not be negative.\u00a0;)<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusions<\/h3>\n<p>Android and iOS are both fantastic and very similar\u200a\u2014\u200abut very different. If a person has only used one of these devices (or is currently using one daily and not the other), there will be noticeable differences and frustrations. As a technology enthusiast and professional interaction designer, even I am frustrated when trying to jump back and forth and expecting thing A to happen but getting thing\u00a0B.<\/p>\n<p>I think for minimal function apps like Instagram it\u2019s not a bad thing to have one design with subtle differences; and for innovative applications or games that will need a person to learn a new behaviour anyway\u200a\u2014\u200awhy not design it the\u00a0same.<\/p>\n<p>However, as the complexity of an application grows, the OS interaction and design patterns become VERY important to design around and Facebook is a great example of making those types of decisions based on real user feedback and iterative platform\u00a0updates.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Have you used both iOS and Android as your daily\u00a0device?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>What do you think about the differences between the two experiences?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/_\/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c32a02c3c06a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/adjust-creative\/designing-for-android-and-ios-c32a02c3c06a\">Designing for Android and iOS<\/a> was originally published in <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/adjust-creative\">Adjust Creative<\/a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.<\/p>\n",

I feel like gesture-based navigation patterns are and were better on Android. iOS has gotten WAY BETTER over the\u00a0years.<\/p>\n<p>Still, some things that Google has designed for user feedback with gestures makes a lot of\u00a0sense.<\/p>\n<p>The best example is the <a href=\"https:\/\/material.google.com\/motion\/material-motion.html\">immediate response animations<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When I tap on something within Android\u200a\u2014\u200aI see a \u201chit area\u201d with a subtle ripple effect and when I pull on a list or other pullable element and it\u2019s at the end of it\u2019s scroll, the \u201cend of the road\u201d pull feedback helps me quickly understand what\u2019s happening and to move\u00a0on.<\/p>\n<p>One of the other gestures that I love about the Android OS has to do with Notifications and settings, which I outlined\u00a0earlier.<\/p>\n<p>They\u2019re also a lot easier to find on Android. When I pull down from the top with a quick swipe, I can see my current notifications. Then, if I pull a second time, I get the common quick settings shown\u00a0earlier.<\/p>\n<p>From this view, if I want to go to detailed settings and advanced options, I can tap the gear icon and do that. This just feels\u00a0better.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m also a huge fan of just swiping left or right to remove notifications from my pending collection and pulling on them to open up quick options within Android. That also seems more logical than swiping then\u00a0tapping.<\/p>\n<p>But, it\u2019s just a different pattern, not really better than\u00a0iOS.<\/p>\n<p><em>(Note: in Android 7 it seems that they\u2019ve added some icons above the Notifications to jump quickly to certain settings.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>On the iOS side of things, I love the 3D touch gesture to quickly peek at things to get context before interacting with them. I also really like when there are \u201chidden actions\u201d to do more complex things that can be uncovered by swipe type gestures. The problem I see is that it\u2019s inconsistent and I think they get lost a lot of\u00a0times.<\/p>\n<h3>Let\u2019s see some\u00a0pics!<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at some visual comparisons of the designs of both system level and 3rd party app\u00a0designs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Notifications from the lock\u00a0screen<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*ivjsDky0Yj-tTMmW.\"><\/figure><p>Notifications are a bit more streamlined in Android. They appear the same and act the same everywhere they show up\u200a\u2014\u200athe lock screen, the notification tray and as a\u00a0popup.<\/p>\n<p>I just flip them away to make them disappear or tap and pull them to interact.<\/p>\n<p>In iOS\u200a\u2014\u200aI can\u2019t do that\u200a\u2014\u200aI have to choose an option after swiping. Also, from a purely design, they feel a bit more like action items in Android and more like a list of things that have happened in\u00a0iOS.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, it looks like in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/ios\/ios10-preview\/\">iOS 10, Apple has completely overhauled<\/a> the notifications and the notification system resembles Android functionality very closely in terms of\u00a0UI.<\/p>\n<p>But, they\u2019ve taken a step further and added 3D touch for rich interactions to the notifications.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Home Screen<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*4QemHdGWPBYvdNGt.\"><\/figure><p>Although it\u2019s a little scary sometimes, I like being able to see the <em>new notifications<\/em> numbers floating on the home in iOS. On the flip side, I like the ability to Google search everything right there at the top and not have to flip over to the left to start searching for things\u200a\u2014\u200aif I\u2019m not using Siri or Google\u00a0Now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Common Settings: Quick\u00a0Menu<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*pqSkDzej0xyv9m_j.\"><\/figure><p>Quick Settings are very similar in terms of functions. To reveal, in iOS, you swipe up from the bottom and in Android you swipe down from the\u00a0top.<\/p>\n<p>On Android, as stated before, once for notifications and a second time for settings.<\/p>\n<p>But, those two quick gestures are fast and feel comfortable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Detailed Settings<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*On_OrneEAoDXpX7p.\"><\/figure><p>One of the things that I do like about iOS is continuity within standard operating system settings and app settings. The design metaphors are similar on all of the OS level applications.<\/p>\n<p>This is just my opinion, but, I also feel like they get rid of unnecessary white-space\u200a\u2014\u200awhereas Google has an abundance of white-space.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cOk Google\u201d vs \u201cHey\u00a0Siri\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*eL3J7ugFSD5Qh3li.\"><\/figure><p>I love <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search\/about\/learn-more\/now\/\">Google\u00a0Now<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I know it\u2019s kinda creepy\u200a\u2014\u200abut it really does start to become amazingly helpful the longer you use it and the more information it has about you and the way you interact with digital services. It knows that I take cabs, where the traffic clusters are, what news I might be interested in based on what I\u2019m talking about in email and Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s nice.<\/p>\n<p>Siri is also pretty valuable, but doesn\u2019t send information about you to the cloud and is more safe feeling, but less useful in certain contexts.<\/p>\n<h3>Default Applications<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Camera<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*AsfCOKrgel0qK_tZ.\"><\/figure><p>The camera UI for both is so similar. They have slightly differing capabilities, but I\u2019d say overall they feel about the\u00a0same.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Calendar<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*zuq9vVeqHW143OOy.\"><\/figure><p><em>Note: I know these are not the same view of the calendar. I did this on purpose to show how drastically different they are in terms of UI design. On iOS the calendar is smooth, streamlined and easy to look at. Android\u2019s calendar on the other hand is complex, way too colorful and gives me\u00a0anxiety.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In my opinion, the calendar is where Apple really wins. Being a busy and also a design-focused person who cares about how things look and feel\u200a\u2014\u200aAndroid\u2019s calendar is terrible.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve consistently tried to find a better calendar to replace\u00a0it.<\/p>\n<p>For a while I was using the closest thing Android has to iOS calendar: Sunrise Calendar. Sadly, Sunrise was discontinued by Microsoft and I had to move to\u00a0Cal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Messaging<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*a08njunHoNcIGB6K.\"><\/figure><p>Text messaging is another area where Apple gets it right and Google has been struggling for quite some time. Not only is the functionality fantastic, but the design is pleasing on iOS. Even better, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/ios\/ios10-preview\/\">in iOS 10<\/a>, the messaging application is getting some of those features that Facebook Messenger users love\u200a\u2014\u200arich animated\u00a0texting.<\/p>\n<p>Google has struggled with Google Voice integration, what app to use for SMS &amp; MMS, group texts and other technology and infrastructure issues.<\/p>\n<p>That aside, the design for Hangouts just plain sucks for my taste and I can\u2019t stand that bold green color. It feels like the designer wasn\u2019t finished\u2026<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*FNoLV1cZSP1HdNro.\"><\/figure><p>Just get it together Google. This is the area you need to be much better at\u200a\u2014\u200atext &amp; media messaging\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong>Clock \/ Timer \/\u00a0Alarms<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*J88hzcjgAGygjadx.\"><\/figure><p>I like both and the differences are very obvious. I think in the Android version, colors are easier to read in the morning when I\u2019m frantically trying to throw the phone across the\u00a0room.<\/p>\n<h3>3rd-party Apps With Similar UI Design\u00a0Patterns<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Uber &amp; Lyft (almost\u00a0exact)<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*bL6ECSDdFPIcbYGu.\"><\/figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*yZMDG4bvzghtjKvg.\"><\/figure><p>Not only are the Uber and Lyft apps almost indistinguishable from each other on the separate devices\u200a\u2014\u200athey also look SO SIMILAR in terms of a\u00a0product.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Instagram<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*MqtJ79I8xk7IyAZA.\"><\/figure><p>Instagram is so close. There are very subtle differences and they are mostly around icon style. But, I really like that they abandoned the \u201cios nav icons should have accompanying text\u201d philosophy. It really makes it feel less busy around the nav\u00a0area.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bank of\u00a0America<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*4L9Zmss2cOuE4qA7.\"><\/figure><p>I\u2019m not sure why the colors are darker on Android, but that\u2019s interesting to me. Other than that it\u2019s really similar with Material Design-inspired forms on\u00a0Android.<\/p>\n<h3>3rd-party Apps that share app guts but use the UI Design Patterns of the respective platform<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Grubhub<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*IT5MXpRv2lYAHqYV.\"><\/figure><p>Grubhub is almost the same UX flow. Like Bank of America above, they use a couple of Material Design elements, but they don\u2019t really feel implemented on\u00a0purpose.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Trello<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*JUUoQ7sgy1L__nac.\"><\/figure><p>Trello is an interesting one. It\u2019s got many of the same patterns in the meat of the application. The clear differences are the very core differences of iOS and Android\u200a\u2014\u200anavigation and menu system placement and Trello seems to get it right. I don\u2019t like that Green button on the\u00a0right.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Spotify<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*8HM4B8nSdo33Bvd8.\"><\/figure><p>Like the last few examples, Spotify has the same major features and user flow with different navigation metaphor. Everything that is \u201cSpotify\u201d functionality has similar interaction patterns.<\/p>\n<p>My favorite part about Spotify is this: Do you see that gradient behind the player controls on Android but not on iOS? That\u2019s not what Google would\u00a0do.<\/p>\n<p>The thing that\u2019s interesting is that after using both, I think the hidden menu on Android hinders me and what I\u2019m looking for on\u00a0Spotify.<\/p>\n<h3>Apps with Different UI Design\u00a0Patterns<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Facebook<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*iRf5TEFHWk5Ev08E.\"><\/figure><p>The Facebook app is maybe the most different from platform to platform. You can see years of evolution and analytics being put into practice here. The design patterns follow almost exactly how the users of each OS use the app based on A\/B testing and continuous iterations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Twitter<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*1ol-Ja8KJahLiATN.\"><\/figure><p>Twitter\u200a\u2014\u200alike Facebook\u200a\u2014\u200ais very closely following the guidelines from each of the respective operating system developers. The most interesting thing to me about Facebook and Twitter is that EVEN THE DATA FEEDS are different on different devices..<\/p>\n<p><strong>Robinhood<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*9bhjLEWsUzf-fZEi.\"><\/figure><p>Some of the design pattern choices could have been made because of a staggered release. (Robinhood released on iOS first and then released on Android later.) They do a great job at not only branding and trying to be disruptive, but also following the design guidelines from Apple and Google almost EXACTLY for each\u00a0app.<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, they do it very, very\u00a0well.<\/p>\n<h3>Complaints<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Where is my damn phone\u00a0number?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s 2016 and I don\u2019t have time to memorize phone numbers. My phone takes care of it for me and I can concentrate on things I\u2019m good at. This is a struggle for me when talking to say, a phone or utilities company representative and I need to give them the phone number of the phone and I can\u2019t find\u00a0it.<\/p>\n<p>Android hides the phone number in an illogical place:<\/p>\n<p><em>Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Status &gt; SIM Status &gt; My Phone\u00a0Number<\/em><\/p>\n<p>iOS hides the phone number in a logical\u00a0place:<\/p>\n<p><em>Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Phone\u00a0Number<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Not enough transparency on\u00a0iOS..<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I know it\u2019s a cliche, but I\u2019m a computer nerd and I like to have more control over how and when I use files. Not having a file system is very annoying.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll explain <strong><em>one<\/em><\/strong> of my reasons for this complaint:<\/p>\n<p>I write and record a lot of music. When I\u2019m done for that day\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019ll bounce my music down to an mp3 and put it in a shared folder on Google Drive so all the people I\u2019m collaborating with or want feedback from can have the most current\u00a0files.<\/p>\n<p>On Android, I can easily download those mp3s and play them with the default apps or 3rd party ones. However, on iOS, due to the lack of transparent file system\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m not be able to do that and am forced to download 3rd party software to interface with cloud storage or convert things in iTunes and sync the\u00a0phone.<\/p>\n<p>Now, this may sound like a lame complaint\u200a\u2014\u200abut for someone who uses computers and technology as much as I do\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s very frustrating to not have the ability to download files on whatever device I need those files currently to manipulate, read, upload somewhere or email to someone that needs\u00a0it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Android still has bugs\u2026\u00a0still..<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s just because Android is more transparent about it and shows me when bugs happen, but it feels like there are at least 1\u20132 bugs every time I have do a lot with the phone at\u00a0once.<\/p>\n<p>I could probably go on, but let\u2019s not be negative.\u00a0;)<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusions<\/h3>\n<p>Android and iOS are both fantastic and very similar\u200a\u2014\u200abut very different. If a person has only used one of these devices (or is currently using one daily and not the other), there will be noticeable differences and frustrations. As a technology enthusiast and professional interaction designer, even I am frustrated when trying to jump back and forth and expecting thing A to happen but getting thing\u00a0B.<\/p>\n<p>I think for minimal function apps like Instagram it\u2019s not a bad thing to have one design with subtle differences; and for innovative applications or games that will need a person to learn a new behaviour anyway\u200a\u2014\u200awhy not design it the\u00a0same.<\/p>\n<p>However, as the complexity of an application grows, the OS interaction and design patterns become VERY important to design around and Facebook is a great example of making those types of decisions based on real user feedback and iterative platform\u00a0updates.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Have you used both iOS and Android as your daily\u00a0device?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>What do you think about the differences between the two experiences?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/_\/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c32a02c3c06a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/adjust-creative\/designing-for-android-and-ios-c32a02c3c06a\">Designing for Android and iOS<\/a> was originally published in <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/adjust-creative\">Adjust Creative<\/a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.<\/p>\n",

      "description": "\n<p>As a person who designs and builds things that allow people who use computers solve their problems\u200a\u2014\u200aI frequently have to answer questions about why I approach the work that I do in the way that I do. At the core, it\u2019s because I think that designing things well makes a noticeable difference in our environments, our attentiveness and most importantly\u2014our feelings and\u00a0moods.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/600\/1*UjaaCYrxxyG4DowB1JDPuQ.jpeg\"><\/figure><p><strong>Design Thinking<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Design Thinking<\/em> as a term may be a bit of a buzzword these days, but the thought process behind it dates back to Herbert A. Simon\u2019s 1969 book <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sciences-Artificial-Herbert-Simon\/dp\/0262691914\"><em>The Sciences of the Artificial<\/em><\/a><em>. <\/em>A human-centered, solution based approach to design is to start with goals and requirements and create within those specified guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>With this problem solving approach we, as designers, define a as many requirements up front as possible. We analyze and synthesize what the would-be goals are for the people who are meant to interact with the end product and determine what the business goals are. Sometimes it may take a few discovery iterations to truly get to the absolute goals. But, when they are clearly spelled out and guidelines are put in place\u200a\u2014\u200adesign thinking methodologies really make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Among many great designers and technologists in the world today, I think the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ideo.com\/\">IDEO<\/a> has made some impressive strides in implementing some of these processes to facilitate innovation. If you are unfamiliar with them, look them\u00a0up.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/626\/1*Drmhlsl_X-YpolD1S4ee3w.jpeg\"><figcaption>Image taken from IDEO: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ideo.com\/work\/design-for-social-impact-workbook-and-toolkit\">https:\/\/www.ideo.com\/work\/design-for-social-impact-workbook-and-toolkit<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Impact on Human\u00a0Behavior<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well thought out design can change the way people feel and interact with your business, your environment or ultimately\u200a\u2014\u200ayou. It devises courses of action to pivot existing situations into more preferred ones.<\/p>\n<p>Often times, companies create a product or service with the intention of facilitating desirable behaviors and create undesirable ones unintentionally. A good example would be the social platform, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/\">Reddit<\/a>. At it\u2019s core, the platform is meant to be a free-speech and news voting platform. In theory, this is awesome because the news that most people care about is at the top where more people can find it. In my opinion, where it falls short is that because it\u2019s loosely moderated, the community is subject to bullying and very negative conversations around certain topics with little-to-no repercussions.<\/p>\n<p>If that platform, however, were to have set forth ground rules and guided interactions from the get go and enforced them on an as-needed basis, that behavior could have been curbed. Would it have become as\u00a0popular?<\/p>\n<p>Who knows.<\/p>\n<p>What we do know is that studying patterns and finding similarities can help define and develop ideas and platforms for which the people interacting are guided in the way that the platform means to direct them. Then using design philosophies we translate those findings into a tangible product, experience or platform.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*oBqTXpUYYOeCy0AY-kMfFg.jpeg\"><\/figure><p><strong>Value for\u00a0Business<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Design is a key element in a brand\u2019s reputation. It\u2019s an investment in that brand\u2019s future and the ability to accurately portray it\u2019s innovative thinking, brand positioning and the way people communicate with each\u00a0other.<\/p>\n<p>Successful businesses include design as an integral part of business strategy from the outset. The reason is simple\u200a\u2014\u200ahaving design integrated with the business goals at an early stage can save money and result in a better experience for your customers. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gocompare.com\/covered\/2011\/11\/ten-classic-cases-of-false-economy\/\">False economy<\/a> is real and you should try to avoid it at all\u00a0costs.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\u201cIf you think good design is expensive, you should look at the costs of bad design.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aRalf Speth CEO,\u00a0Jaguar<\/blockquote>\n<p>When research-based design is integral to a company\u2019s innovation and positioning, it shapes ideas to become practical and attractive propositions for customers.

      "content": "\n<p>As a person who designs and builds things that allow people who use computers solve their problems\u200a\u2014\u200aI frequently have to answer questions about why I approach the work that I do in the way that I do. At the core, it\u2019s because I think that designing things well makes a noticeable difference in our environments, our attentiveness and most importantly\u2014our feelings and\u00a0moods.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/600\/1*UjaaCYrxxyG4DowB1JDPuQ.jpeg\"><\/figure><p><strong>Design Thinking<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Design Thinking<\/em> as a term may be a bit of a buzzword these days, but the thought process behind it dates back to Herbert A. Simon\u2019s 1969 book <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sciences-Artificial-Herbert-Simon\/dp\/0262691914\"><em>The Sciences of the Artificial<\/em><\/a><em>. <\/em>A human-centered, solution based approach to design is to start with goals and requirements and create within those specified guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>With this problem solving approach we, as designers, define a as many requirements up front as possible. We analyze and synthesize what the would-be goals are for the people who are meant to interact with the end product and determine what the business goals are. Sometimes it may take a few discovery iterations to truly get to the absolute goals. But, when they are clearly spelled out and guidelines are put in place\u200a\u2014\u200adesign thinking methodologies really make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Among many great designers and technologists in the world today, I think the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ideo.com\/\">IDEO<\/a> has made some impressive strides in implementing some of these processes to facilitate innovation. If you are unfamiliar with them, look them\u00a0up.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/626\/1*Drmhlsl_X-YpolD1S4ee3w.jpeg\"><figcaption>Image taken from IDEO: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ideo.com\/work\/design-for-social-impact-workbook-and-toolkit\">https:\/\/www.ideo.com\/work\/design-for-social-impact-workbook-and-toolkit<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Impact on Human\u00a0Behavior<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well thought out design can change the way people feel and interact with your business, your environment or ultimately\u200a\u2014\u200ayou. It devises courses of action to pivot existing situations into more preferred ones.<\/p>\n<p>Often times, companies create a product or service with the intention of facilitating desirable behaviors and create undesirable ones unintentionally. A good example would be the social platform, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/\">Reddit<\/a>. At it\u2019s core, the platform is meant to be a free-speech and news voting platform. In theory, this is awesome because the news that most people care about is at the top where more people can find it. In my opinion, where it falls short is that because it\u2019s loosely moderated, the community is subject to bullying and very negative conversations around certain topics with little-to-no repercussions.<\/p>\n<p>If that platform, however, were to have set forth ground rules and guided interactions from the get go and enforced them on an as-needed basis, that behavior could have been curbed. Would it have become as\u00a0popular?<\/p>\n<p>Who knows.<\/p>\n<p>What we do know is that studying patterns and finding similarities can help define and develop ideas and platforms for which the people interacting are guided in the way that the platform means to direct them. Then using design philosophies we translate those findings into a tangible product, experience or platform.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*oBqTXpUYYOeCy0AY-kMfFg.jpeg\"><\/figure><p><strong>Value for\u00a0Business<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Design is a key element in a brand\u2019s reputation. It\u2019s an investment in that brand\u2019s future and the ability to accurately portray it\u2019s innovative thinking, brand positioning and the way people communicate with each\u00a0other.<\/p>\n<p>Successful businesses include design as an integral part of business strategy from the outset. The reason is simple\u200a\u2014\u200ahaving design integrated with the business goals at an early stage can save money and result in a better experience for your customers. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gocompare.com\/covered\/2011\/11\/ten-classic-cases-of-false-economy\/\">False economy<\/a> is real and you should try to avoid it at all\u00a0costs.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\u201cIf you think good design is expensive, you should look at the costs of bad design.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aRalf Speth CEO,\u00a0Jaguar<\/blockquote>\n<p>When research-based design is integral to a company\u2019s innovation and positioning, it shapes ideas to become practical and attractive propositions for customers.

I\u2019ve taught in various situations both in classrooms and outside of them. This article is meant to give a bit of an intro to a couple of the philosophies that I think have helped me continue to do creative work with creative and innovative people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Focus Your\u00a0Passion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Finding your passion(s) in a creative field is not always that easy. If you\u2019re like most of us, you have a lot of areas of interest. Most of the time your focus shifts over time or maybe you struggle figuring out where to focus. If you keep at it, after a while you start to appreciate the overlap of your interests and how they benefit one\u00a0another.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re just starting out or switching careers, I think it\u2019s crucial to focus on a specific interest and really dig into the nuances of what can be crafted from that interest. You may find out that your passion and what you\u2019re actually good at are not the same thing at all! But, that\u2019s part of the learning\u00a0process.<\/p>\n<p>This takes time. It\u2019s just a fact of life. But, all great things take time,\u00a0right?<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*8HK6s2yT32vNC-xEgo3uXA.jpeg\"><\/figure><p><strong>Work Ethic<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The single most important part of being a creative person in the real world is understanding that you have to continuously hone your craft. There are a lot of us on this earth and that means a lot of competition. Companies prefer to work with someone that has incredible work ethic rather than a rockstar with no sense of standards.<\/p>\n<p>Teamwork is extremely important. Whether you\u2019re working as an independent maker or in a group, you will be working with other people and those people will rely on you to work hard and communicate well.<\/p>\n<p>Integrity stretches to all aspects of your livelihood. It fosters trusting relationships with clients, coworkers, supervisors and everyone else in your life. Coworkers will value your opinions and ability to give quality feedback. Clients trust your advice. All will rely on you for moral standards and being a team\u00a0player.<\/p>\n<p>In all aspects of you as a collaborative or independent, you need to have a strong sense of responsibility. When you feel personally responsible for your piece of the puzzle, you\u2019ll show up on time and put in your best of your abilities.<\/p>\n<p>It takes a certain level of commitment to finish your tasks every day.

Sometimes talent blows people away and sometimes it blows fleeting into the wind. However, if you\u2019re diligent and tenacious you will be able to perform consistently over time. Consistent effort is what creates the best results. It gives ideas time to develop and teams of people the ability to produce great work over\u00a0time.<\/p>\n<p>Innovation companies are the best example. I imagine if you sit for a second you can think of plenty of ideas that would <em>\u201cchange the world\u201d<\/em>. Now, can you think of how you will produce these ideas into something that changes human behaviors in the right way to accomplish that bombastic goal?<\/p>\n<p>Most likely\u00a0not.<\/p>\n<p>It will take time, iterations, and consistently working towards the end goal\u200a\u2014\u200aeven while that end goal shifts with the movement of life\u00a0itself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Always Deliver<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I cannot stress this one enough. If you consistently deliver the goods, the folks you interact with will appreciate the value that you bring to the\u00a0table.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t the easiest to estimate in the early stages of your career because every project is different. But, over time it becomes easier. The more lessons you learn and the more you hone your craft, the more you\u2019ll be able to foresee similar patterns. At the end of the day, if you say you\u2019re going to do something\u200a\u2014\u200ado it. If you don\u2019t think you can do it, don\u2019t lie about it.

Sometimes it means looking up to the people who have already done something similar to what you\u2019re trying to do and understanding why they made the decisions that they did. Understanding those patterns and decisions can help you get from A to B faster and bring more value to the\u00a0table.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Spread the\u00a0Word<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to get the word out about yourself, your craft and the things that you\u2019ve made for the world.

You should have your own website or at least a place where you can showcase your work to others and an easy way to find\u00a0it.<\/p>\n<p>You can then talk about it with the myriad social media platforms, in-person at events and parties and even paid advertising and PR. There are many avenues to promote yourself and your craft. Figure out your audience. Then figure out how and where to speak to\u00a0them.<\/p>\n<p>If you have questions\u2014feel free to ask me in the comments below. I love helping\u00a0people!<\/p>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/_\/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=697d4f500dd3\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/adjust-creative\/want-to-be-a-creative-professional-697d4f500dd3\">Want to be a creative professional?<\/a> was originally published in <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/adjust-creative\">Adjust Creative<\/a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.<\/p>\n",
